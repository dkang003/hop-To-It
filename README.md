#####Back-end of Like/Unlike Code
Proud of our create/patch brewery logic... if Brewery already exists in the database... then check to see if the currentUser's Id already exists in the brewery's user database... if it does NOT then push the currentUser's Id into the selected brewery's users array and save, then push the selected brewery's brewId into the user's favorites array and save the updated User.

If the currentUser has already liked the brewery (currentUser's Id already exists in the brewery's users array, then search for the currentUser's id index and use that index to remove from the users' array.  Similarly do the same for searching for the brewId index in the user's favorites array and using that index to remove it from the favorites array.

## Some problems we ran into:
1. Passing current user as props to our profile page.
2. Modeling our Brewery and Photo models.
3. Axios CORS block.
4. Pinging our DB from the React front end and passing data from front end to back end.
5. Adding functionality of like/unlike toggle button.
6. Heroku issue with it not findiing our ./Navbar file.


## Things I didn't get to do/finish:
1. Wanted to utilize AWS to incorporate a Photo model for users to be able to add photos to the breweries: a) Adding a third model/schema for the uploaded Photos.
2. A search feature to change the location.
3. Add a star or heart "like/favorite" button in place of the Milligram like/unlike button.
3. Use Semantic UI to re-design the site.
